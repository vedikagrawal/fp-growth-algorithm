# 🧠 FP-Growth Algorithm — Market Basket Analysis

This repository contains a Python implementation of the **FP-Growth algorithm** for frequent itemset mining and association rule generation. The algorithm is highly efficient and scalable for large datasets compared to Apriori, making it ideal for market basket analysis.
